Well, this is it, my last blog post! It has been a crazy, but valuable experience. I'm going to talk about the good, the bad, and the neutral.

# Good
* Exposure to different tools, especially industry-grade tools: I feel like I have learned the importance of build management, tracking issues, team coordination, and style guidelines after taking this class. I already knew it was important to work together as a team and coordinate, and that good style is important, but I wasn't a stickler about build management or branches or tracking issues (for example, most of the time I would get something fixed right away, without marking it as an issue). This class introduced some useful tools for these things, like autopep8, which formats code automatically, Pydoc, which makes documentation automatically, and Travis CI, which is good for build management.
* No busy work/the assignments make sense: All the assignments are very useful and make you feel accomplished and like you learned something.
* Good for resume and web development: You end up with a nice project to show off on your resume. You can even learn full-stack, if you want.
* Makes you feel more prepared for an internship/job: I actually feel a lot better about starting full-time in September! 

# Bad
* Long lectures: This is not specific to this class, but it would be much easier to pay attention if it was only an hour versus two hours.
* Pacing (summer class): Take this over the semester! I wouldn't say it was a horrible experience, but you will have much more time to actually learn, rather than just throw some code together. For example, when you are pressed for time, you try to focus on implementing something and getting it working, rather than understanding the why and how.
* The quizzes: You will do badly on a lot of quizzes. Be prepared! They are hard to study for, because they identify gaps in your knowledge or edge cases you didn't think to ask about and don't know the behavior of. It's especially difficult since sometimes you are short on time, and if you miss a question, you make a 60 or so (there are only usually 3 questions).

# Neutral
* Disconnect between tests, class, and projects: The lectures go into extreme detail, about edge cases and behavior of funcions, methods, etc. Sometimes I didn't even think I wanted to know this much detail about Python! While I don't fully understand the importance of such extreme detail, it is interesting and I do see how if you didn't know enough about what code you're using, you could make a mistake that would be hard to identify. However, the tests are usually more generic and less detailed and focus on writing code. The projects have to do with making a web application, including a database. The tests and projects feel useful, though I'm not completely convinced about the lectures.

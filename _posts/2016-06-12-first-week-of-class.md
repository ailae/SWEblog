What did I do this week? I set up this blog you're on now, and did a lot of the project (acceptance tests, basic solution).

What's in my way? The optimization to the point that Sphere will accept it without it timing out.


What will I do next week? Go to office hours and try to figure out what I'm doing wrong...

# My thoughts

### The project
I'm not sure how I feel about it right now. The instructions and the fact that it's the first project and the way it was described made me think it was going to be easy, but the fact that Sphere isn't accepting my optimization makes me worry and think I underestimated the project (even though I started early). I'm potentially just doing something stupid.

### Class
I never thought I would learn such specific details about Python, but I suppose it's kind of interesting. I think it's good to know the intricacies of the languages, but I end up forgetting a language's syntax as soon as I start using another one and always need a refresher. Perhaps once I start using a language more often and constantly I will know these small details about it.

Honestly, class gets a little boring sometimes but it doesn't help that we have a 2-hour class. MWF for one hour would be much more manageable. I do like that he calls on people and tries to make it interactive, even though it's a little stressful if you don't know the answer or what he wants you to say.

### Quizzes
I just got the one text book I had to order in, so hopefully I can start reading soon. It sucks that the quizzes are only three questions and you have so little time to do them, though.
